scrapingthebeatles
==================
This is a small script I wrote to parse the list of the Beatles songs into an indexed JSON file with attributes for title, year, and album. 

As usual, I had lots of help from StackOverflow

Files {#files}
===============
`scraper.py` is the main script, and `beatles.json` is it's output.

You'll notice that there are still a couple of encoding issues, I think mainly with the song 'BÃ©same Mucho'.

You'll also notice a couple of failed and commented out attempts to fix them.

I may or may not eventually come back to try to fix them. For now, I'm satisfied with it. My main goal here was to learn BeautifulSoup basics, and I consider that goal accomplished.
